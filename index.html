										<h2 class="major">Technology & Information Systems</h2>
										<p>This course will introduce students to information systems and technology (IS/IT), as well
											as its uses in daily life both at home and at work. Various aspects of IS/IT encompassing
											hardware, software, network, communications, internet, multimedia, graphics and systems
											applications will be introduced. Students will be equipped with basic skills in handling PC
											installation and productivity tools via practical work in the labs, which shall comprise a major
											part of the study. At the end of the course, student should be able to distinguish basic IS/IT
											component and applications.</p>

											the field of computer science. The topics that are covered in this course are set theory,
											proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph
											theory, trees and finite automata. At the end of the course, the students should be able to
											use set theory, relations and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and
											solve problems using recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and
											trees in real world problems and use deterministic finite automata finite state machines to
											model electronic devices and problems.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Digital Logic</h2>
										<p>Digital electronics is the foundation of all microprocessor-based systems found in
											computers, robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. This course introduces the
											students to digital electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts,
											components, and tools. Students will get up-to-date coverage of digital fundamentals-from
											basic concepts to programmable logic devices. Laboratory experiments provide hands-on
											experience with the simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the
											classroom.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Programming Techniques I</h2>
										<p>As a fundamental subject, this course equips the students with theory and practice on
											problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. Students are required to
											develop programs using C++ programming language, in order to solve simple to moderate
											problems. The course covers the following: pre-processor directives, constants and
											variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures: sequential, selection
											and loop, built-in and user-defined functions, single and two-dimensional arrays, file
											operations, pointers, and structured data types.
